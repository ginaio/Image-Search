# HELIX RE Homework

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

After cloning this project, you need to import dependencies using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
$ npm i
```

Create a file for environment variables named `.env.local` and set its contents to

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Start the app with the following command. Your browser should automatically open a new tab on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```sh
$ npm start
```

For popup of the pictures

```sh
npm install reactjs-popup --save
```

## Notes

Function B "filter images based on the content" is unfinished.
I was not quite sure about the function A "visualise images..", so I separated two functions in two pages temporarily.
